Urban microclimate, outdoor thermal comfort, and urban greenery
----

This collection of studies includes research articles focusing on the interactions between urban greenery and urban microclimate. They are developed from my Master's theis (Beijing-based) and my ongoing PhD study (Hong Kong-based).

Reviews for linking research and practice
----

This collection of studies are review studies that are aimed at linking researchers and practitioners. The gap between researchers and practitioners is, on one hand, hampering practitioners from making good use of the knowledge derived from research, and on the other hand, hampering researchers from focusing on topics that are of the practitioners' interest. These review articles are expected to provide holistic information on particular topics within the scope of urban sustainability that may provide insights for both sides.
