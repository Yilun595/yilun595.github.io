This repository assists in calculating view factors from fisheye images. It offers an alternative to using the Rayman software. Currently, it contains three functions, supporting calculating SVF following `Rayman algorithm` and the algorithm by `Johnson and Watson (1984)`.

This implementation was first used in [this publication](/publication/BAE2025), calculating SVF profile from panoramic videos.
