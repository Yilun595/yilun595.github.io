This ongoing PhD project is aimed to assist evidence-based design of future-heat-resilient public spaces. It will discuss how the diversity of thermal environment can be created and utilized to enhance the thermal experiences in outdoor area.

<b>[02]</b>  [Urban green spaces’ atmospheric cooling in Beijing, China](/research/2020-UGScooling)

Master degree thesis, <i>Beijing Forestry University</i>, 2020.

Urban heat island has long been documented, as well as the significant cooling effects of urban green spaces (UGS). Yet evidence on UGS’s atmospheric cooling remained insufficient, especially incorporating a cross-scale perspective. By taking urban parks in Beijing as study cases, this research project evaluated the regulating effects of urban green spaces on micro to neighborhood scale cooling. The atmospheric cooling intensity of urban parks and their components were examined, as well as their influencing factors. Results are expected to guide future evidence-based planning and design of urban parks in Beijing, as well as future renewal of these urban parks located at the core area of Beijing, China.

<b>[03]</b>  [Phenological changes of landscape plants in Beijing, China](/research/2017-Phenology)
----

Undergraduate thesis, <i>Beijing Forestry University</i>, 2017.

<img src="/images/PhenoMap.jpg" alt="icon" style="width: 700px; height: auto; border: 1px solid grey;"/>

Phenological changes of vegetation bring diversity to the urban landscape, especially in temperate regions. By taking Beijing as a study case, this research project evaluated the phenological changes of landscape plants at both individual and plant community level. Results obtained were expected to aid selection of plant species in planting design.
