This ongoing PhD project is aimed to assist evidence-based design of future-heat-resilient public spaces. It will discuss how the diversity of thermal environment can be created and utilized to enhance the thermal experiences in outdoor area.

Diversity of microclimate conditions under extreme heat
----

This work documents the diversity of microclimate conditions in typical residential public spaces under extreme heat through field measurements. It reveals that even under extreme heat, thermally comfortable spaces exist.

Diversity of summertime thermal and environmental perceptions during outdoor walking
----

Following the aforementioned work, this section evaluates the human perceptions when walking along different types of public spaces in summer. Combining mobile measurements, field survey, and physiological parameter measurements, this section builds the pathway among the built environment, human physiological parameter, and thermal and multisensory environmental perceptions.
